    "content1": "As a freelance artist, I find joy in working with oils, watercolors, tempera, and pastels, with a special focus on graphic arts. Nature deeply inspires me — from the quiet of a snow-covered forest to the vibrant greens of summer. Each piece is a heartfelt attempt to capture the beauty of our world, infusing it with a part of my soul.",
    "content2": "I’m a member of the Union of Russian Artists and regularly participate in exhibitions. My work is featured in private collections across Russia, Germany, and the USA."
